[h1]Mod is for 3.4. Don't use with other versions of the game[/h1]

This is a mod which intends to make my AI mod, [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1712760331]Starnet AI[/url] work better with [url=steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=683230077]NSC2[/url] (New Ship Classes and more). It also works with starnet's fork, [url=steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2494712590]Startech[/url].

It requires NSC2 and Starnet to function (detailed instruction below).

[h1]What is Starnet[/h1]

Starnet is an AI overhaul which intends to make AIs much more aggressive. Digital enemies will build and support significantly larger fleets and will be happier to kill anyone who didn't manage to do the same.

Recommended settings: Commodore, no scaling, 1-3 advanced empires. After your first game feel free to adjust the difficulty.

For more info, check the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1712760331]main mod's page[/url].


[h1]Installation instructions.[/h1]

For the mod to function you need to enable (preferably in this order)

1)UI overhaul dynamic (NSC requires it)
2)~ Starnet or Startech
3) NSC2 Season 6
4)! Starnet for NSC2 (this mod)

Do not use this mod without Starnet or Startech. Do not use this mod without NSC2.

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]

Compatibility with other mods is mostly unknown. 
If you are using any mod impacting districts, use [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1635222296]Universal Districts Patch[/url], it will help make things compatible.

[h1]Final remarks[/h1]

Both this patch and Starnet is a work in progress, but it still should perform well enough to 
provide formidable enemies and an action-packed experience. 

In the future I am planning to teach AI to use Support Ships/Strike Cruisers better and possibly make
midgame fleet composition more varied (for example make AI sometimes use carriers as their main force).

If this patch isn't working the way you want I would be very happy if you reported it. Sometimes NSC requires
reset to function well (deleting the mod, unsubscribe, then subscribe again).
